# coralic Meta Knight – SEO for Kirby

Our opinionated fork of diesdas.digital's Meta Knight—a SEO and Social Media Sharing Plugin for [Kirby](https://getkirby.com). Meta Knight makes it easier to work with meta information in Kirby's panel.

This fork includes several improvements as well as some customizations to meet our clients' needs, such as:

- Simplified options (via `metaknight-simple` tab blueprint)
- Specialized site-wide options
- Template support via [Kirby's Query language](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/blueprints/query-language)
- Translation support (currently English + German)
- Default Twitter/OG image preview

As well as some internal changes:

- Preview generation on the backend for QL support
- KirbyUp as bundler instead of Parcel

In addition to the original plugin features:

- Basic Meta Information (Title, Description, Keywords, Canonical URL, etc.) + Google Search Preview
- Open Graph + Facebook Sharing Preview
- Twitter Cards + Twitter Cards Preview
- Robots Settings

We'd like to thank Jonathan Muth, Lorenz Seeger and Leslie Büttel at [diesdas.digital](https://www.diesdas.digital) for their lovely plugin. We love it and use it on almost all projects since <3
